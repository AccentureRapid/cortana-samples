Here is a list of samples that showcase how you can join Cortana's team of experts:

**[Adventure Works Voice Command Sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/CortanaVoiceCommand)**

This app showcases how developers can integrate their apps with Cortana's speech and language understanding capabilities. 
When Cortana is listening, any of the following voice commands are supported. By default, "London", "Melbourne", and "Yosemite National Park" are provided as sample destinations. New destinations can be added in the app.

- "Adventure Works, show trip to London"
- "Adventure Works, when is my trip to London"
- "Adventure Works, cancel trip to London"

Infix and suffix forms are also supported.

- "Show trip to London in Adventure Works"
- "Show my Adventure Works trip to London"

Duplicates can also be handled. For an example of handling disambiguation, add a second trip to London in the app and try the following:

- "Adventure Works, cancel trip to London"
